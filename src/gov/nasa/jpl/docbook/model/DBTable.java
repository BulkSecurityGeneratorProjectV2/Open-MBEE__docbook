/**
 * A docbook table<br/>
 * Body and headers are essentially 2d matrix (headers can be multi-line)<br/>
 * Cells in body and header must be instances of other DocumentElement. If you
 * only want some simple text in a cell, use DBText.<br/>
 * If you want complex elements in a cell, use DBTableEntry which allows a list
 * of DocumentElements as its content. DBTableEntry needs to be used if you want
 * your cell to span.<br/>
 * If a cell is not a DBTableEntry, it'll automatically add the docbook entry
 * tags, so use DBTableEntry only if you have a complex cell.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * A list of DBColSpecs can also be set, these need to be filled in if any cell
 * has a span.<br/>
 * The rows of the header and body 2d matrix doesn't all have to have the same
 * amount of "columns".<br/>
 * If you have cells that span, the spanning info will take care of the
 * alignments, do not put in null or empty things if the cell's spanned by
 * something else.<br/>
 * Ex. if your first header row has a cell that spans two rows, your second
 * header row would have 1 less cell than the first, because one cell is
 * "covered" by the spanning cell in the first row.
